# Traffic_prediction


## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting traffic conditions using time series analysis. The objective is to handle the complexities of spatial relationships between roads, environmental conditions, and temporal dynamics to forecast traffic patterns accurately.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed, along with the following packages:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- StatsModels
- TensorFlow

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels tensorflow
```


I see that you've uploaded a file named Time_Series_Final_Project.ipynb. To help you create a README file for this project, I'll first need to examine the contents of the notebook to understand its purpose, functionality, and requirements. Let's start by extracting the information from the notebook.

The notebook you've provided is a time series analysis project focused on predicting traffic conditions. Here's an outline of the contents from the notebook:

Content Overview:
Libraries and Setup: Imports necessary Python libraries and sets some initial configurations.
Data Loading: Reads traffic data from a CSV file named "traffic.csv".
Literature Review: Discusses the complexities and challenges of traffic prediction, highlighting the influence of road interconnectivity, varying conditions, and non-linear dynamics in traffic patterns.
Data Description: Details the structure and attributes of the dataset, which includes hourly traffic data across multiple junctions.
Data Preparation: (Further details were not provided in the initial output but it's a common step involving cleaning and structuring data for analysis).
Analysis and Modeling: (Presumed from the imports) The project likely involves statistical tests, visualization, and machine learning models to forecast traffic.
Based on these details, here's a draft for your README file:

# Time Series Final Project: Traffic Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting traffic conditions using time series analysis. The objective is to handle the complexities of spatial relationships between roads, environmental conditions, and temporal dynamics to forecast traffic patterns accurately.

## Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed, along with the following packages:
- NumPy

- Seaborn
- StatsModels
- TensorFlow

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels tensorflow

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in traffic.csv, containing hourly traffic data across various junctions. Each entry includes the date and time, junction identifier, vehicle count, and a unique ID.

## Usage

To run this project, simply execute the notebook cells sequentially. Ensure that the dataset traffic.csv is in the same directory as the notebook.
