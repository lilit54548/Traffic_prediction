# Traffic_prediction


## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting traffic conditions using time series analysis. The objective is to handle the complexities of spatial relationships between roads, environmental conditions, and temporal dynamics to forecast traffic patterns accurately.

## Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed, along with the following packages:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- StatsModels
- TensorFlow

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels tensorflow
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in traffic.csv, containing hourly traffic data across various junctions. Each entry includes the date and time, junction identifier, vehicle count, and a unique ID.

## Usage

To run this project, simply execute the notebook cells sequentially. Ensure that the dataset traffic.csv is in the same directory as the notebook.
